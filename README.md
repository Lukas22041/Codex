Repository for a Starsector Discord bot.
If you want to run the bot on your own, requires a "bot-token.txt" file including only your bots token in the same folder as the jar.
Also requires a "database" folder, located in the location of the jar. 

To load starsector content, paste the starsector-core (has to keep the name) folder in to the database folder. To load mods, simply put the Root Mod folder in to the database folder.
