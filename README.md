# Codex

A Discord bot that dynamicly loads data from starsector and mods.
The Bot is made by using the "Kord" Library and written fully in Kotlin.

If you want to run the bot on your own, requires a "bot-token.txt" file including only your bots token in the same folder as the jar.
Also requires a "database" folder, located in the location of the jar. 

To load starsector content, paste the starsector-core (has to keep the name) folder in to the database folder. To load mods, simply put the Root Mod folder in to the database folder.
